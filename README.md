# MyCreditCard

It's an application built to train Java Collections concepts, like List and Sort. 

# How does it work?

## Credit Card

First, you are presented to your bank application that shows you some important things, such as name and limit you can spend on a shopping mall.

## Shopping List

Here, you can see a list of products to buy on a shopping mall, and then based on your limit buy stuff until you stop the program or have no more money.

## List and Sort

To conclude, I use here the Java Collections Framework to put all things you bought on a list and then sort it based on their price.
